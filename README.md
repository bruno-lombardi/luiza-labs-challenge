## :rocket: Technologies

The following tools and packages were used to develop this project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org)

## üíª Project

This project is an HTTP API that allow customers to save their favorite products.

### Getting started
Install project dependencies using your favorite package manager, `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
$ yarn install && yarn post:install
## or:
## npm install && npm run post:install
```
Run the `post:install` to setup husky.

After that, you can start the development using docker, just make sure you have the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed. Just run:

```sh
$ yarn up
```
To see your changes reflect live in the docker container, run `yarn build:watch`.
### Testing
It is strongly recommended to use Test Driven Development techniques while developing this software. Run your tests while you make changes to the code.

To run unit tests:
```sh
$ yarn test:unit
```
To run integration tests:
```sh
$ yarn test:integration
```
When you push changes to the repository, husky will automatically run the script `test:ci`, that runs both integration and unit tests with coverage.
You can also run `yarn test` manually to not generate code coverage.

### Documentation
To access API endpoints documentation, start the docker service with the `yarn up` command, and open [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
